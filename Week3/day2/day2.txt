The purpose of this database project is to efficiently store, manage, and analyze academic 
information within a university system. The database will track key entities such as Students, 
Lecturers, Courses, and Enrollments, ensuring that relationships between them are clearly defined. 
Students can register for multiple courses, each course is taught by one or more lecturers, and 
enrollment records link students to their chosen courses. The scope includes maintaining accurate 
records of student details, lecturer profiles, course structures, and enrollment history, 
providing a reliable foundation for academic management, reporting, and future data analysis.
